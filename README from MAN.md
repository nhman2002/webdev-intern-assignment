# NOTE from Man
- My project is constructed mainly with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am well aware that if the project was contructed by React it will be more efficient and the code would be cleaner. So i have to apologize first because i'm now in the middle of taking a React course from F8 education (https://fullstack.edu.vn/ here is the link to it website). So that i'm not confident enough to code this project with library.
- I am not be able to deploy the demo of this project on heroku because when i'm trying to sign up an account the heroku website has some errors that won't let me register.

# How to deploy the project
- You just have to clone my project to your laptop or PC. Next you need to have the live server extensions installed on your VSCODE IDE. If you don't, please make sure to install it.
- Then turn on the server extension on the index.html file and my project will be deploy on your browser (Chrome for an exemple).

# About the things I didn't complete
- I haven't complete the function when you add up the number of shoes in your cart, the total value didn't add up to the desire value. And also the subtract button (when you want to decrease the number of shoes).
- I haven't complete the function when you don't want that pair of shoes in your cart anymore, and also the subtraction of the total value of your cart.
- I haven't include the animation like your live demo or something similar to have a better user experience.

# Self evaluation
- Well, for self evaluation, i need to improve my skill on Javascript more and more reach the efficiency that i'm satisfied with.
- If the project is code is constructed by React, it'll be better for the DEV which myself and also the DEV whether they want to use my code or further upgrade, as well as the efficiency of the website and also the user experience. So that i need to finish my course on React library as soon as possible in order to achieve that goal.
- I need further research on the animation section to figure out what is the optimal solution increase the user experience.
